This project involves comprehensive analysis and machine learning model development on a dataset of space mission launches. Visualization of the dataset was performed using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. Subsequently, predictions on mission statuses were made using RandomForestClassifier, and the model's performance was evaluated.
